    <h2>Why pursue programming?</h2>
    <p>I decided to take a class in programming in order to improve my skills. I recognise that programming is an important skill to have. The trends in my current line of work as a network engineer is towards software defined networking, automation and infrastructure as code. Coding skills will help me to implement the new technologies in an efficient manner. I also decided to pursue a class in programming for future career opportunities that will arise as a result of knowing how to code.</p>
